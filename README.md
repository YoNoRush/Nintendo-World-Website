# Suepr Nintendo World Website
My own design of the Super Nintendo World Website.

## Running the Website
Download the zip of the project, extract it, then open it on Visual Studio Code. **You'll need to install the 'Live Server' extension in the extensions area**. After installing it, go to the 'index.html' file and run the site by clicking the 'Run Live Server' button on the bottom right. Navigate the site as you please.

## Program Requirements
Run this site using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).<br>
Download the 'Live Server' extension in the extensions tab.
